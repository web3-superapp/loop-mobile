# LOOP current product decisions

> Canonical current scope. Updated 2026-08-24.

This document applies to the Flutter source at the repository root. Material under `reference/legacy-prototype/` is frozen history and does not override these decisions.

## Product shape

- LOOP is a Flutter iOS and Android app. Web output is only a local UI-verification target.
- The six primary destinations remain Home, Market, Launch, Chat, Wallet and Profile.
- Perpetuals remain inside Market rather than becoming a seventh primary destination.
- Privy is the selected login, wallet and final authorization boundary.
- Hyperliquid Core BTC, ETH and SOL are the selected perpetual markets. HIP-3, builder fees and a second trading core are out of scope.

## Pay priority and delivery

Product priority and current delivery are separate:

- B5 remains Core, B6 and B7 remain Phase one, and B8 remains Later.
- B5 through B8 are all deferred from the current release.
- Home keeps one Pay card labelled `Coming soon` so the planned product position remains visible.
- Every Pay route is informational only. It must not open a scanner, request camera access, collect an amount or recipient, select a payment provider, or submit a transaction.

## Communication

- Stream Chat plus Stream Video/voice is the selected communication integration.
- The current Flutter code contains an unconfigured, fail-closed integration seam and preview memory data. It does not prove that a Stream SDK, token service, chat write or voice room is live.
- A persistent group with 200,000 members is not a verified Stream capability. LOOP must obtain written provider confirmation covering membership, message semantics, reactions, mentions, history, search and moderation before promising it.
- Without that written confirmation, the product must adopt a sharded-group or channel model and update the information architecture before implementation.

## Identity and safety language

- An internal immutable `user id` is the primary identity for accounts, social relationships and communication-provider mapping.
- Wallet addresses are bindable and replaceable credentials. They are not database primary keys, public chat identities or communication user IDs.
- LOOP does not present an AI Guard brand or a proprietary risk score.
- Safety UI may show concrete, attributable facts such as simulation asset changes, allowance scope, malicious-domain signals, policy state and source time. Missing or stale evidence fails closed.

## Delivery truth

- Preview and memory adapters are UI evidence only.
- Production status requires configured SDKs, short-lived server-issued tokens, testnet or sandbox evidence, native-device verification and observable provider responses.
- The production BFF remains responsible for server-only credentials, token issuance, stable error mapping, rate limits, audit events and request correlation.
